TODO for next hardware iteration:
- static ports further away from screw-mount but also not too close to the tip
- consider changing the type of pressure sensor (smaller range, better resolution)
- improve the connection of pressure sensor to the metal parts
- try to fit a USB-C onto the PCB connector, because cool.
- implement a flash storage chip, to increase sample rate
- implement inter-rocket-wifi/bluetooth to connect to avionics
