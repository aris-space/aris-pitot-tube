TODO for next hardware iteration (order: relevance):
- [Structure] static ports further away from screw-mount but also not too close to the tip
- [Electronics] change the DEBUG connector to something better (e.g. Tag-Connect)
- [Electronics] try to fit a USB-C onto the PCB connector, because cool.
- [Electronics] implement a flash storage chip, to increase sample rate
- [Electronics] consider changing the type of pressure sensor (smaller range, better resolution)
- [Structure] improve the connection of pressure sensor to the metal parts
- [Electronics] implement inter-rocket-wifi/bluetooth to connect to avionics
