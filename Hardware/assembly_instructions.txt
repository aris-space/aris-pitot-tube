- test if the thermocouple cable fits through the smaller diameter of the guiding tube (we left it out and filled the hole with play-doh)
- glue the tubes into the bottom mount, pay attention that it is straight!
- guide the thermocouple cable through the bottom mount and tubes
- glue the K-Type thermocouple into the tip
- glue the tip on top of the tubes
- mount the barometer-sensor PCB (clamp it down with the holder-part) to the bottom mount and seal everythign with play-doh (pay attention not to put play-doh on the sensor membranes)
